I also uploaded this excel file in this folder so you can download it to see.

### Task2 automated test
Then I use monkeytest(https://monkeytest.it/) to do the automated test to my web app.
I test my resume page(https://shuangzhao95.github.io/) and my friendly chat web(https://friendlychat-by-shuang.firebaseapp.com/) seperately.

This is the automated test result of my resume page:(https://monkeytest.it/test/c73fca9e-9c5b-46fa-ad56-a128b1157018)

This is the automated test result of my friendly chat web:(https://monkeytest.it/test/10b206a7-ce0d-49f3-9698-adddfbb5c1b1)
