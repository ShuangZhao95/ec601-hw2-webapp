# ec601-hw2-webapp

This is the hw2 of ec601 design by Shuang Zhao (zs1995@bu.edu)


## For task1 

Just go to this website(https://shuangzhao95.github.io/) then you can have a look at the resume web app design by me!

In my resume web, you can talk to me or make comments by clicking the green buttom.

The following is a partly screenshot of my resume web page:

## For task2 

I follow the tutorial and make changes to web-start folder to build a friendlychat web.
 
 - [Firebase Web Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web/). 
 - [Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-cloud-functions/).

On top of some basic functions like sign in, sign out and send messages and pictures, this web app can also set notifications, moderate pictures and welcome new users.

In task2, I use the authentication, database and storage in the firebase platform.

You can open this FriendlyChat web by clicking the link in my resume page or by clicking the following link.

 - [FriendlyChat By Shuang Zhao](https://friendlychat-by-shuang.firebaseapp.com/).
