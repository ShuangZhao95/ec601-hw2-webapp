## For task2 

I follow the tutorial and make changes to web-start folder to build a friendlychat web.
 
 - [Firebase Web Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web/). 
 - [Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-cloud-functions/).

On top of some basic functions like sign in, sign out and send messages and pictures, this web app can also set notifications, moderate pictures and welcome new users.

In task2, I use the authentication, database and storage in the firebase platform.

You can open this FriendlyChat web by clicking the link in my resume page or by clicking the following link.

 - [FriendlyChat By Shuang Zhao](https://friendlychat-by-shuang.firebaseapp.com/).
